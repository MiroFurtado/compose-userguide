## Content root directory

You add content for your site under the **content root directory** of your Hugo site project - either `content/` or a [language-specific](/docs/language/) root like `content/en/`. The main exception here is static files that you don't want built into your site: you can find out more about where you add these below in [Adding static content](#adding-static-content). The files in your content root directory are typically grouped in subdirectories corresponding to your site's sections and templates, which we'll look at in [Content sections and templates](#content-sections-and-templates).

You can find out more about Hugo directory structure in [Directory Structure Explained](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/#directory-structure-explained).
